        Set the environment variables `GCM_TRACE=1` and `GIT_TRACE=1` and re-run your
        Git command. Review and redact any private information and attach the log.

        If you are running inside of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you must also
        set an additional environment variable to enable tracing: `WSLENV=$WSLENV:GCM_TRACE`.
        For example:

        ```shell
        WSLENV=$WSLENV:GCM_TRACE:GIT_TRACE GCM_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 git fetch
        ```
